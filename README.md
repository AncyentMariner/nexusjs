Nexus.js â€” Multi-threaded I/O for JavaScript.
=======

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/voodooattack/nexusjs](https://badges.gitter.im/voodooattack/nexusjs.svg)](https://gitter.im/voodooattack/nexusjs?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Nexus.js is a multi-threaded JavaScript run-time built on top of JavaScriptCore (Webkit) with a focus on high performance and dynamic scaling above all else.

Nexus.js uses an asynchronous non-blocking I/O model, and a thread-pool scheduler to make the most of modern hardware concurrency.

Nexus.js is Promise-based and embraces ES6 in full; as a result, it is not compatible with Node.js APIs.

## Building

#### Build Requirements

* [JavaScriptCore (WebKit)](https://webkit.org/)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org)
* [Boost](http://www.boost.org)
* [ICU](http://site.icu-project.org/)

#### Obtaining WebKit

To build Nexus.js, you'll need to build WebKit from the sources,

To checkout WebKit using git:
```
git clone git://git.webkit.org/WebKit.git WebKit
```
Or you might wish to do a shallow clone to avoid a longer download:
```
git clone --depth 1 git://git.webkit.org/WebKit.git WebKit
```
Please see the [build guide](https://webkit.org/building-webkit/) for how to build WebKit from sources.

Alternatively, you can obtain a copy of the [nightly build](https://webkit.org/nightly/).

#### Obtaining Nexus.js

Simply clone Nexus using git to your chosen directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/voodooattack/nexusjs.git nexusjs
```

#### Building Nexus.js

After making sure you have all the dependencies installed, use CMake to build Nexus.js. I recommend using [CCMake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/ccmake.1.html) (or your favourite CMake UI)
```
$ cd nexusjs/
$ mkdir build
$ cd build/
$ ccmake ..
```
## Documentation

The Nexus.js API is a shifting haze. Because it changes so much from commit to commit, no documentation is currently available; but you can look into the [tests directory](tests/) for an insight into how to use it.

Fear not, though! For a comprehensive manual is planned! Along with a package manager to make Nexus proud!

## Native add-ons

While still a big topic for debate, native add-ons should be very feasible in the future, once a proper ABI is chosen. Please discuss this [here](https://github.com/voodooattack/nexusjs/issues/4).

## FAQ

* Will you implement `require()`?

> Not likely. Nexus.js will use the Promise-based `import(...)` API for dynamic loading, and otherwise use the `import` and `export` keywords for normal module loading.
> `require()` can still be implemented by a third-party in pure JavaScript of course, it just won't come built-in.

* Why are you avoiding `require()`? Are you planning on breaking all backward-compatibility with Node.js?

> Yes. I know the decision is harsh, but it will be better in the long run.
> It will make porting libraries harder, but the result will be a pure ES6 ecosystem with ES6 modules at its core.
> This is necessary because Nexus.js is multi-threaded, and most Node.js libraries use globals in one form or another, which means they'd be broken anyway.
> While accessing globals concurrently will not corrupt them or crash the program, it will produce unexpected behaviour in any event-loop based code. Since it assumes a single-threaded environment.

* How does concurrent access to variables work? Do you use a Mutex for every variable?

> No, please see [Locking in WebKit](https://webkit.org/blog/6161/locking-in-webkit/), it explains it better than I ever could.

* Can Nexus libraries override globals?

> The globals are created on-demand in every context that accesses them, and this makes it impossible to replace them.
> For example, `Nexus.EventEmitter` exists in every context, but if you replace it in a library it will not affect the `Nexus.EventEmitter` available in a different library, or in the main context.
>
> I do plan on offering certain hooks for transpiling utilities and the such. If you're using Babel to transpile JSX for an isomorphic (universal) application, you need not worry.
