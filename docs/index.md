# Welcome to Nexus.js

> This project is currently **under heavy development**, be warned that things will break. 

Nexus.js is a multi-threaded JavaScript run-time built on top of JavaScriptCore (Webkit) with a focus on high performance and dynamic scaling above all else.

Nexus.js uses an asynchronous, non-blocking I/O model, and a thread-pool scheduler to make the most of modern hardware concurrency.

Nexus.js is Promise-based and embraces ES6 in full; and as a result, it is not compatible with Node.js APIs.
